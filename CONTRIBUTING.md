# Contributing to Roblox's only Voxels Engine

A project of this scale would benefit massively from your help. 

Feel free to implement the [planned features](README.md).
Any optimizations and/or improvements to the codebase are appreciated.

## Reporting bugs

Please file an issue containing the following information:
* The error message(s) (if applicable).
* The actions performed to recreate bug.

## Feature requests

The project does accept any "game feature" requests. The aim is to create a voxels engine, not a fully fledged game. That's up to you to create using this engine!

All requests to add mobs, inventory, PvP, etc will be rejected.
